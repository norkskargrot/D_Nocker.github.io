      <p>Welcome to the Tiny Sumo Play Demo! While it is intended for the entire game to be able to be learnt from the rules presented on the card back itself, an example of play is provided here to assist understanding.</p>
<h2 id="setup">SETUP</h2>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo1.png">
<p>Here is the game setup and ready to play, you can see that the fighter markers are in position on the starting dots and the round marker is in place. You can use anything you have lying around as markers whether that is coins, a pen cap, or a meeple. Additionally, each player has taken bid die and four appropriately coloured dice are set aside to be the action pool.</p>
<p>Throughout this demo, we will play as player 1 with the blue fighter, while the red fighter will be our opponent. Keep in mind that the colour of the pawn has no effect on gameplay and is just to differentiate the two.</p>
<h2 id="play">PLAY</h2>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5em" src="/games/tinysumo/demo2.png">
<p>Here each player has taken their bid die, and the shared action die have been rolled. In this round the throw die (in blue) is high, where all of the other die are fairly low.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo3.png">
<p>Because this round has relatively low numbers in the action pool (and no 6s!), we secretly selected a 6 on our bid die, concealed from our opponent. This means our opponent will likely have a lower number, winning the bid and becoming the initiator, but we will have the highest value action die.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo4.png">
<p>Both players now simultaneously reveal their bid die, and our bet was a success! As we predicted, our opponent bid a low value to become the initiator. This means they get priority on taking dice from the action pool, but we have the higher value die.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo5.png">
<p>Our opponent, as the initiator, assigns their bid die first and decided to assign it to their grab action. We assign our die to our grab action also.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo6.png">
<p>Our opponent now gets to take a die from the action pool first, as they are the initiator. They take the highest value die, the blue die, and have to add it to the matching coloured action, throw.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo7.png">
<p>It's now our turn to take a die from the action pool. Let's take the white die which rolled a 3. Because it's a white die, we can assign it to any of our actions. Let's put it on dodge.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo8.png">
<p>The rest of the dice are now taken, in turns, from the action pool. First our opponent takes the red die, and has to assign it to the grab action. We then take the remaining white die and choose to assign it to the grab action.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo9.png">
<p>We now go forward with the actions! First is dodge. Because we have a higher dodge value than our opponent (3 against 0), we get to take the action. The dodge option is optional, but let's choose to go forward with it, swapping the fighter's positions.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo10.png">
<p>The next action is throw. Our opponent has a higher throw value than us so they throw us to the other side of them, pushing us closer to the edge.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo11.png">
<p>The final action is grab, which we have the higher value in. This means that we move both fighters two spaces in a direction of our choice. If we move both fighters to the right, we'd be pushed out of the arena, losing the match! So instead we'll move them to the left, putting our opponent closer to the edge.</p>
<img class = imagewithinpost style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem" src="/games/tinysumo/demo12.png">
<p>That's the end of round 1. We now clear both player's actions, and advance the round marker. We are ready to roll the action die to start the next round! Keep in mind, according to the round track there are only three dice in the action pool this round. This means the initiator gets a bonus die! Bid carefully.</p>
<p>Thank you for checking out Tiny Sumo, and I hope you have as much fun playing it as I have.</p>
